A Pokemon belongs to at least 1 and at most 2 Pokemon types.  There are different stats to measure the combat power of a pokemon, which include HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack Strength, Special Defensive Strength, and Speed. Pokemon are usually released in batches. Thus, they have different generations. In addition, a pokemon can either be a regular pokemon and legendary pokemon. \n",
